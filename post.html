          <h1>Designing for focus in noisy organizations</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Focus is a design constraint. If we treat it as a cultural feature,
            we can build environments where teams go deep without disappearing.
          </p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              The modern organization is loud by default. Slack, email, doc
              threads, and meetings create ambient noise that distorts decision
              quality. To protect focus, we need structural moves, not just
              personal discipline.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Reduce decision surface area</h2>
            <p>
              Every meeting and message is a decision surface. Clarify where
              decisions happen, document them once, and route follow-up to a
              single channel. The best teams obsess over visibility more than
              velocity.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Create default calm</h2>
            <p>
              Establish a weekly cadence for updates and reviews. When people
              know when they will be heard, they stop escalating everything.
              Predictability is the foundation of calm.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Design for asynchronous depth</h2>
            <p>
              Move first drafts to documents. Encourage a 24-hour read window
              before debate. Depth thrives when people have time to think before
              they react.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Focus is an environment we build together, not a feeling we chase
              alone.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              These shifts are not glamorous, but they compound. When focus
              becomes a shared expectation, teams spend more time building and
              less time recovering.
