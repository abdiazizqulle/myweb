If your strategy docs are ignored, the structure is likely the issue. Write
with a clear thesis, an operating model, and crisp next steps.

## The 3-part structure
1. One-page thesis
2. Decision log
3. Execution plan

## Add a decision map
Show which groups can decide, consult, or veto. It prevents circular debates.
