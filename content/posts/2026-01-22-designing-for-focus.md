The modern organization is loud by default. Slack, email, doc threads, and
meetings create ambient noise that distorts decision quality. To protect focus,
we need structural moves, not just personal discipline.

## 1. Reduce decision surface area
Every meeting and message is a decision surface. Clarify where decisions happen,
document them once, and route follow-up to a single channel. The best teams
obsess over visibility more than velocity.

## 2. Create default calm
Establish a weekly cadence for updates and reviews. When people know when they
will be heard, they stop escalating everything. Predictability is the
foundation of calm.

## 3. Design for asynchronous depth
Move first drafts to documents. Encourage a 24-hour read window before debate.
Depth thrives when people have time to think before they react.

> Focus is an environment we build together, not a feeling we chase alone.

These shifts are not glamorous, but they compound. When focus becomes a shared
expectation, teams spend more time building and less time recovering.
