High-velocity teams stay effective when they treat operations as product
decisions. A small set of clear rituals removes ambiguity and protects focus.

## A simple weekly cadence
- Monday: priorities + risks
- Wednesday: quick midpoint signal check
- Friday: outcomes + learning

## Make decisions visible
Share decisions in one place with a clear owner. The goal is to prevent
re-arguing, not restrict collaboration.

## Keep experiments lightweight
Time-box what you test. You want fast signals, not perfect proof.
